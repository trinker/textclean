Description: Tools to clean and process text.  Tools are geared at
        checking for substrings that are not optimal for analysis and
        replacing or removing them with more analysis friendly
        substrings.  For example, emoticons are often used in text but
        not always easily handled by analysis algorithms.  The
        'replace_emoticon' function replaces emoticons with word
        equivalents.
